    <h1>Reports</h1>
    <p>Reports window shows reported for specified Route and its schedule.</p>
    <p>First, you can choose Route.</p>
    <img src="../images/reports_routes.png" />
    <p>Also, you can leave both of these fields blank, and then a report for all routes and schedules will be generated.</p>
    <p>To remove the selected route, press the Clear button.</p>
    <p>The same goes for selecting and clearing the schedule.</p>

    <p>When you have specified all the attributes, press the Get Report button.</p>
    <p>If you have chosen Months you will see the Report for the Month period, with sections as seen below.</p>
